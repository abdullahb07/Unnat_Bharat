  <tr>
    <td>What is it? 
      <br>Blood Collected straight from the donor into a blood bag and
      <br>mixed with an anticoagulant is called as whole blood. This 
      <br>collected whole blood is then centrifuged and red cell, platelets
      <br>and plasma are separated. The separated Red cells are mixed with 
      <br>a preservative to be called as packed red blood cells.
    </td>
    <td>What is it?
      <br>Plasma is the clear yellowish fluid component of blood
      <br>that holds the blood cells in suspension. It is also known 
      <br>as the liquid part of blood. It is composed of 90% 
      <br>water and contains proteins, electrolytes, and 
      <br>dissolved gases.
    </td>
    <td>What is it? 
      <br>Platelets are small, irregular, colorless cells 
      <br>that help stop bleeding. They are much smaller 
      <br>than red or white blood cells and are made in the 
      <br>bone marrow. Platelets stick together to form a 
      <br>plug that helps seal up a blood vessel.
